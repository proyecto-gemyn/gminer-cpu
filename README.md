**gminer-cpu** is a miner for the **Gemyn** cryptocurrency and is for those who doesn't have GPUs and want to mine their own cryptocurrencies using their normalcomputers.

**gminer** as other similar programs are usually flagged as malware by antivirus programs. This is
a **false positive**, they are flagged simply because they are cryptocurrency 
miners. The source code is open for anyone to inspect. If you don't trust
the software, don't use it.

We have tried to improve those AV blocks.

Enjoy!
